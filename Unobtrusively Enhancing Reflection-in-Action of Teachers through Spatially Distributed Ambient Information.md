## Unobtrusively Enhancing Reflection-in-Action of Teachers through Spatially Distributed Ambient Information

**ACM CHI 2019**

### 1\. Research Background and Objectives

- **Importance of Teacher Reflection**: The process of teachers reflecting on their actions during teaching (Reflection-in-Action, RiA) is crucial for optimizing teaching behaviors.
- **Existing Challenges**: There are challenges for teachers to engage in reflection during daily teaching due to the need to find time for contemplation amidst busy teaching schedules.
- **Technological Assistance**: The paper explores how Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) systems can support teachers' RiA in real-time scenarios.

### 2\. Basic Concepts

- **Reflection-in-Action (RiA)** - Reflection during action: Refers to the contemplation of one's actions while they are being performed, allowing for immediate optimization of behavior. In the field of teaching, this refers to teachers' immediate reflection on and adjustment of their teaching behaviors during the teaching process.
- **Ambient Information System** - An information system that provides information through devices distributed in the environment, aiming to unobtrusively support users' behaviors and decisions.
- **Distributed Cognition** - The cognitive process is distributed across multiple agents (people or technology) and the external environment, emphasizing that cognition is not limited to the individual brain but is achieved through interaction with the environment.
- **Teacher Proximity** - The physical closeness of teachers to students, which may affect students' learning behaviors and teacher-student interactions.
- **ALACT Model** - A model describing and training the reflective process of teachers, including five stages: Action, Looking back on action, Awareness of essential aspects, Creating alternative methods, and Trial.
- **Peripheral Displays** - A display technology that provides information in the peripheral vision of users, aiming to minimize interference with their main tasks.
- **Cognitive Offloading** - The practice of transferring cognitive tasks to external tools or environments to alleviate the burden on the brain.

### 3\. Introduction to the ClassBeacons System

- **System Components**: Composed of lights distributed in the classroom and an indoor tracking system that tracks the real-time location and orientation of teachers.
- **Functionality**: Demonstrates the proximity of teachers to students through color changes in the lights, helping teachers understand how they allocate time and attention in the classroom.

### 4\. ClassBeacons Workflow:

1. **System Deployment**: Before teachers begin using ClassBeacons, researchers install and calibrate the system on the desks of student groups or pairs according to the layout of each classroom.
2. **Initial Introduction**: Teachers receive a brief brochure introducing the display rules of ClassBeacons and are encouraged to request further explanations if needed.
3. **Understanding Display Rules**: Each teacher must confirm their understanding of the display rules before first using the system.
4. **Teaching Activities**: Teachers carry out their regular teaching plans in their usual classrooms.
5. **Real-Time Feedback**: The ClassBeacons system provides real-time feedback to teachers through color changes in the lights distributed in the classroom. The color transition from yellow to green indicates the amount of time the teacher spends near specific students.
6. **Observation and Reflection**: During the teaching process, teachers observe the color changes of the lights and reflect on their spatial proximity to students and the time and attention allocated to different students.
7. **Adjusting Teaching Behavior**: Based on the feedback provided by ClassBeacons, teachers may confirm their current teaching behaviors (e.g., confirming that they have given extra attention to a certain group) or notice new issues in their teaching behaviors (e.g., realizing that they may have neglected a student) and adjust their upcoming actions accordingly.

### 5\. Design Principles

- **Theory-Based**: Four design principles are proposed based on the core characteristics of RiA, aiming to support teachers' RiA.
    
    - P1: Provide information related to ongoing teaching activities.
    - P2: Encourage teachers to interpret the displayed information themselves.
    - P3: Support concurrent use with other ongoing tasks.
    - P4: Support quick, easy, and easily discardable short-term engagement.

### 6\. Empirical Research

- **Participants**: 11 secondary school teachers.
- **Method**: The use of the ClassBeacons system in 22 classroom cycles.
- **Data Collection**: Feedback and experiences from teachers are collected through semi-structured in-depth interviews.

### 7\. Research Findings

- **Support for RiA**: ClassBeacons triggers three types of teacher reflection:
    
    - Confirming ongoing performance.
    - Giving new meaning to ongoing performance.
    - Modifying upcoming actions.
- **Embodiment of Design Principles**: Teacher feedback shows how ClassBeacons embodies the proposed design principles in practical use.

### 8\. Discussion and Future Work

- **System Advantages**: ClassBeacons, as an ambient information system, can enhance teacher RiA without affecting teaching activities.
- **Future Directions**: Suggestions for future research directions include improving system design, long-term deployment studies, and the development of systems that combine real-time reflection with post-reflection.

### 9\. Conclusion

- **Contribution**: The paper provides empirical knowledge on how to enhance teacher RiA through ambient information systems and proposes a set of design principles.
- **Universality of Design Principles**: Although the principles are proposed based on the ClassBeacons system, they are applicable to future HCI designs to support teacher RiA in an unobtrusive manner.
