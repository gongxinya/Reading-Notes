## Abstract and Background

- The paper introduces a visual analytics framework for assessing and comparing the evolutionary processes of multi-objective optimization algorithms.
- Multi-objective optimization algorithms often consider multiple conflicting objectives in real-world applications and are typically treated as black boxes, making in-depth analysis difficult.
- The use of visual analytics tools can enhance the understanding of algorithm performance, particularly in comparative analysis.

## Main Contributions

1. An interactive visual analytics framework is proposed for explaining and comparing multi-objective optimization algorithms.
2. A set of visualization and interaction designs are developed to facilitate exploration and comparison of algorithms, iterations, and individual solution sets.
3. Case studies and interviews demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in analyzing two test problems.

## Key Concepts and Technologies

- **IGD (Inverted Generational Distance)**: A metric for measuring the distance between a solution set and a reference set.
- **HV (Hypervolume)**: A metric for measuring the volume of the objective space covered by a solution set.
- **MS (Maximum Spread)** and **SP (Spacing)**: Metrics for measuring the uniformity of the distribution of a solution set.
- **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**: Used for dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data to display algorithm similarity in a two-dimensional space.
- **kNN Graph (k-Nearest Neighbors Graph)**: A graph used to illustrate the similarity between different generations.

## Visualization Framework

- **Algorithm-level Comparison**: Compares algorithms at a high level, showing relationships between different algorithms through quality measures and algorithm similarity views.
- **Evolution-level Exploration**: Explores the evolutionary patterns of algorithms through quality measure views and timeline views.
- **Solution-level Inspection**: Inspects individual solution sets directly by comparing different generations' solution sets through a solution set view.

## Visualization Encodings

1. ## **Algorithm-level Comparison**:
    
    - **Scatter Plots**: Encode the similarity between different algorithms using the position of points, with high-dimensional data represented in a lower dimension through t-SNE.
    - **Color**: Different algorithms are distinguished by different colored points, allowing users to quickly identify and compare the performance of specific algorithms.
    - **Point Size**: May represent the performance of an algorithm on specific quality metrics, such as IGD or HV values.
2. **Evolution-level Exploration**:
    
    - **Line Charts**: Display the trend of quality metrics across different generations, revealing the evolutionary dynamics of the algorithm.
    - **Timeline Views**: Present the distribution of solution sets for each generation through side-by-side scatter plots, showing changes in solution distribution across generations.
    - **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Used to visualize multi-dimensional data points in a two-dimensional plane, facilitating the visualization of high-dimensional data.
3. **Solution-level Inspection**:
    
    - **Scatter Plots**: Enlarge and display the target space data distribution of selected generations, allowing users to conduct detailed comparisons of solution sets.
    - **Contour Plots**: Use kernel density estimation to show the density distribution of solution sets, with varying shades of color indicating different densities.
    - **Outlier Marking**: Different symbols (such as crosses) highlight outliers and extreme values, which are often important features in the optimization process.
4. **Generation Similarity View**:
    
    - **kNN Graphs**: Use nodes and edges to represent the similarity between different generations, with the thickness or color intensity of edges possibly indicating the degree of similarity.
    - **Clustering**: Clustering algorithms (such as HDBSCAN) are used to identify groups of generations, represented by graphical elements like bubbles.
5. **Reference Set Visualization**:
    
    - **Scatter Plots, Density Plots, Alpha Hulls**: Offer different viewing modes to display the reference set, supporting users in understanding the true Pareto front from various perspectives.
